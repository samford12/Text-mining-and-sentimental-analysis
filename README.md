This project applies Text Mining and Sentiment Analysis to pharmaceutical data from Kaggle. 
It involves data preprocessing, text mining, and model development using techniques like K-Means, Random Forest Classifier, 
and Logistic Regression. The Random Forest Classifier achieved the highest accuracy for predicting drug effectiveness based on the patient reviews. 
These models accurately classify new reviews, highlighting the effectiveness of text mining and sentiment analysis techniques.
